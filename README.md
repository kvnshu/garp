# garp

## Inspiration
With experience on machine learning research projects and talking to peers, we sought a better way for the sharing of information and learning in the field of academia

## What it does
Researchers can add and remove papers from a reading list, and can add other researchers on the platform and view in a feed what other researchers have added to their reading list.

## How we built it
garp is a web CRUD application built with Supabase, Next.js, React, Tailwind, and NextUI. With varying levels of technical background on this stack, we pair programmed and relied on Git's version control features to make regular progress on the app.

### Tech Stack

**Client:** React, TailwindCSS, NextUI

**Server:** Next.js

**Backend:** Supabase

## Challenges we ran into
Our biggest challenges were in the first 10% of the project, setting up the database and implementing user authentication. We initially tried Vercel Postgres but ran into issues with the limitations of the free plan.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are most proud of implementing the social features of the app, adding/removing users and seeing what other users are reading.

## What's next for garp
A number of features would be valuable for users of the app, including the development of a browser extension, the ability to add notes to saved papers, folders to organize papers, and automated title-generation based on the URL.
